# Allows to use "diff-so-fancy" to compare files that are not controlled by Git.
# Under the hood it makes use of "git diff" by using the "no-index" option which allows to compare the given two
# paths/files on the filesystem outside a working tree controlled by Git.
#
# @param $1 the path/files to compare
# @param $2 the path/files to be compared
# @see https://github.com/so-fancy/diff-so-fancy/issues/220#issuecomment-282530252
